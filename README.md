## What ?

Plain Geometry Editor is a [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org) plugin to edit geometry of features using WKT (well-known text) or WKB (well-know binary.

## How ?

1. Select the layer you want to edit, and turn editing on.
2. Click then on the ![plugin icon](https://raw.github.com/3nids/plaingeometryeditor/master/icons/plaingeometryeditor-24.png) to identify a feature.
3. If a feature is found, a dialog opens in which you can edit the geometry in WKT or WKB.

Changes can only be applied if the new geometry is valid!
