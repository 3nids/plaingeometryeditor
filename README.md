## What ? 

Plain Geometry Editor is a [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org) plugin to edit geometry of features using WKT (well-known text) or WKB (well-know binary.

## How ?

Select the layer you want to edit, and turn editing on. 
Click then on the compass icon to identify a feature.
If a feature is found, a dialog with a text area containing the WKT of the feature can be edited.
Changes can only be applied if the new geometry is valid!
